DSA- Data Structure & Algorithm

Definition- Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can use efficiently . (e.g- Array, Linked Stack, queue)

Algorithm- Algorithm is a step by step methods to solve problems using data structures . (e.g- Searching, sorting, Shortest path)


DSA= How to store data + how to use it smartly to solve the problems

--> In conclusion, DSA is about learning how to arrange data properly and solve problem efficiently.
